## Overview
In recent years, domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs) have attracted more attention in academics and industry because of their expertise and in-depth representation in a specific domain. However, when constructing a domain-specific KB, one needs to address not only the challenges in constructing a general KB, but also the difficulties raised by the nature of domain-specific raw data. Considering the usability of financial Knowledge Bases (KBs) in many downstream applications, such as financial risk analysis and fraud detection, we propose a Platform for Temporal Financial KB Construction, K-Quant Platform.
